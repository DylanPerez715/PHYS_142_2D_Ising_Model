Burnin_Heat_Conclusion_plots.ipynb
This is a python notebook that contains the code for creating the figures for Burnin steps, The magnetization vs temperature and B field plot shown in the presentation. This file also contains the calcualtions done to dind the specific heat and the plots as well as the critical exponent as well. 
In order to run the file, you run cells under each section. The section provide the guide to ditinguish each cells and which part it corresponds to.
