# PHYS 142 Final Project: 2D Ising Model

Welcome to the repository dedicated to Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulations for exploring the properties of the 2D Ising model. This repository includes a series of files  for conducting simulations and generating plots that illustrate various aspects of the model.

## File Overview

Here is a table of the contents provided within this repository. Each file is designed to facilitate a specific part of the simulation process and data visualization:

| Filename    | Description | 
| -------- | ------- |
| Burnin_Heat_Conclusion_plots.ipynb | Creates visualizations for choosing Burn-in steps, figures of M vs T and M vs B, plots for specific heat, and calculates the critical exponent of specific heat.  |
| PHYS142FinalProj_PartB_MvsB.py  | Creates a plot of magnetization vs. magnetic field, implemented with multiprocessing package.  |
| PHYS142FinalProj_PartB_MvsT.py |  Creates a plot of magnetization vs. temperature, implemented with multiprocessing package. |
| PHYS142FinalProj_PartC.py    |  Creates a phase diagram of magnetization in temperature and magnetic field, implemented with multiprocessing package.  |
| PHYS142FinalProj_Susceptibility.py | Creates a plot of susceptibility vs. temperature, implemented with multiprocessing package. |
| PHYS142PartA.py | Produces an animation for the MCMC steps. Visualizes the final states of the system under different initial conditions.  |

To obtain the desired results, simply execute each file.
